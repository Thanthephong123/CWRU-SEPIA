# CWRU-SEPIA

CWRU-SEPIA is a project focused on implementing AI agents in a maze/combat game environment. The agents are designed to navigate through mazes, engage in combat scenarios, and demonstrate intelligent decision-making capabilities.

## Overview

The project incorporates various AI techniques to create efficient and effective agents capable of tackling challenges in the maze/combat game. It includes implementations of heuristic search algorithms, such as A* search, along with other methodologies to enable the agents to navigate the environment, evade obstacles, and engage in combat encounters strategically.

## Folder Structure

The source code of the agents is organized inside the src folder

## Implementation Details

- **Heuristic Search**: The project includes an implementation of the heuristic search algorithm, which enables the agents to explore the maze efficiently by selecting the most promising paths based on heuristic evaluations.

- **A* Search**: Additionally, the project utilizes the A* search algorithm, which combines the benefits of heuristic search with optimal pathfinding, resulting in more informed and effective navigation decisions for the agents.

- **Agent Implementation**: The agents' behavior and decision-making processes are encapsulated within individual Java scripts. These scripts contain the logic for navigating the maze, engaging in combat, and interacting with the game environment.
